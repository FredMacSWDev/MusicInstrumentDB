# **_Music Instrument Database_**
An *Empty Coffee Cups* API Project


## The Project
We've created an API to build an ever-growing database of musical instruments, the instrument families that they classify under, and famous musicians that are known for use of the instrument.  The database is able to cross-reference an instrument to the instrument family it belongs to, as well as musicians that is well-known for using that instrument.

Each instrument contains a description of that instrument, the transposition of the instrument, and the instrument family it belongs to.

## Installation
To download this repository, press the green button that says 'Code'

![Code](https://github.com/FredMacSWDev/MusicInstrumentDB/blob/FredMacSWDev/T11/readme-patch-1/images/GIthub%20Code%20Button.PNG "Code Button")  

From there, select "Download ZIP". When the file has been downloaded, be sure to unzip the folder. Once the folder has been unzipped, locate the solution file and double-click it.

Once the code has been opened in VS Community, you will want to set the "MusicInstrumentDB.WebAPI" assembly as the startup project.  Go to the Solution Explorer, locate the "MusicInstrumentDB.WebAPI" assembly, right-click that assembly and select "Set as Startup Project" from the menu.

You will also need to Restore NuGet Packages in WebAPI Solution by right-clicking the solution and selecting "Restore NuGet Packages."

To test our endpoints to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) database items, we used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), but you are more than welcome to use whichever software suits you best.
